# VarmentTMS

## Introduction

VarmentTMS is an enterprise application that allows users to submit helpdesk tickets using microservices by calling endpoints from the user interface in the browser. 
A headless microservice will automatically assign tickets to technicians. Another microservice can be called that will return a list of helpdesk tickets.
